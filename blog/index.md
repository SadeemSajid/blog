_Salam_,

My name is Sadeem, and I'm a software engineer from Lahore, Pakistan, deeply interested in hardware-level implementations like RDMA, as well as AI and Security. Naturally, I am quite fond of writing: giving structure to my ideas and sharing my knowledge with the people around me.

I also have a deep interest in philosophy and Islam, of which the latter I am pursuing in an academic capacity. Therefore, you primarily should expect three main types of content here:

- Explorations and guides on technology that I work with and am fond of.
- Writings on different domains in philosophy that I explore ranging from metaphysics, logic, and stoicism.
- Academic excerpts, translations, and articles on different sciences related to Islam, including some degree of polemics.

Check out the categories here: [Technology](./tech/index.md), [Philosophy](./philosophy/index.md), [Islam](./islam/index.md).

You will also note that this site is overly minimal and that I attempt to write only what is necessary in addressing the topic. This is a reflection of my personal belief that things should be represented by their minimum realities and that all else should be given form by the perceiver's ideas.

Of course, you will find that achieving this minimalism is at times, impossible. The writer cannot completely rid themselves of the influences of their perception.
